# **Stream Jumper for Mixer.com** #

**Description:**
Stream Jumper is a tool build for moderators on Mixer.com that allow the user to view multiple different Mixer.com chat rooms at the same time without the need for popout chat windows. This makes it easier for a moderator to keep an eye on all chat rooms and jump between them as needed.

**Note**
As of 3-22-16 the repo was split into two branches. The main branch no longer contains automation in order to better match up with mixer policy. The second branch, autolurk, contains automation. This second branch is now deprecated and will not be updated.
