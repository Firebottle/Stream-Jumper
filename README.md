# **Stream Jumper for Beam.pro** #

**Description:**
Stream Jumper is a tool build for moderators on beam.pro that allow the user to view multiple different beam.pro chat rooms at the same time without the need for popout chat windows. This makes it easier for a moderator to keep an eye on all chat rooms and jump between them as needed.

**Note**
As of 3-22-16 the repo was split into two branches. The main branch no longer contains automation in order to better match up with Beam policy. The second branch, autolurk, contains automation. This second branch is now deprecated and will not be updated.
